Why we need repository pattern?

Repository pattern is popular approach to organizing the data access code way that keeps clean, maiatanable and testable.
It act as middle(intrmediate) layer between bussiness login and data layer.
It abstacts the data access layer so that business logic doesn't directly interact with data starage.
BY using this pattern, developer can perform CRUD operation and other data interaction through a central repository class, which helps in managing 	changes to data model easily.
